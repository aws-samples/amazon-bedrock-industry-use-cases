## Contributing

We welcome community contributions! The goal is to keep this sample as a collaborative source-of-truth repository for builders and developers that have industry specific use cases that they have built out on Amazon Bedrock and want to share with the open-source community. The team is constantly building new genAI applications and always looking to push new demos out to automate daily tasks with Amazon Bedrock.
