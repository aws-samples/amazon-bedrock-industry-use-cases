<details>
Acne is a medical condition that occurs when pores on the surface of the skin become plugged. A pore is an opening of a hair follicle (root) and an oil gland. Pores get blocked when the glands make too much oil. Dirt collects, which causes bacteria to grow in the glands. The skin swells and forms painful bumps, commonly called pimples.

<h3>Skin care:</h3>
Be gentle when you wash: Do not rub or scrub your skin with a washcloth. Do not use hot water. Gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel or cloth.
Be careful with the medicines you are taking: Certain medicines, including natural and herbal medicines, may trigger an acne flare-up. Always check for skin changes when you take your medicines. Ask your primary healthcare provider before you use herbal medicines or products to control acne.
Do not squeeze, pop, or pick your pimples: This may damage your skin and cause infection or scarring.
Protect your skin from the sun: Wear sunscreen that has a sun protectant factor (SPF) approved by your primary healthcare provider. Follow the directions on the label when you use sunscreen.
Use water-based, oil-free makeup, soaps, or skin cleansers: Oil-based makeup may make acne worse. Check product labels on water-based makeup, since even these may have some added oil. Use mild soaps or cleansers that are oil-free and do not irritate acne.
